 * Channel is a monotonically increasing data type

 * freezing clients
 *
 * Normally the RevisionChannel is incremented at each height while keeping
 * RevisionNumber the same. However some consensus algorithms may choose to
 * reset the height in certain conditions e.g. hard forks, state-machine
 * breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is incremented so that
 * height continues to be monitonically increasing even as the RevisionChannel
 * gets reset
